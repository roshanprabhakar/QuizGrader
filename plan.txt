Classes:

1. Image api for our specific needs - adapted BufferedImage
2. UserInteractiveGrading system - its own class
3. AnswerField object - just to store x and y coordinates

Algorithm:
1. display blank test //done
2. User goes through test and drags boxes on the parts where there will be answers //done
3. for every question:
     loop through all the responses, display them side by side
     each should have two input boxes under them: 1 for displaying sentence comments,
     the other for typing a relative score for that problem
4. record all data to associated students
5. generate a class summary with all comments and general scores (which questions did people get wrong the most
6. generate student summary, with comments and scores
7. send these scores through email
