## Feedback from our math teacher about QuizGrader

- Instead of having a check box for if answer is right or wrong, have a check box for skills met or not. 
- Add an option for whether or not to add a tag. The dropdown menu can get really long and the user should decide if the tag should be added or not
- Add a field for the teacher to list the skill assessed (Probably a drop down menu similar to tags but you automatically apply the skill to all the other student's problems)
- Find a way to deal with students who write their answers on scratch paper
- Change individual student reports to an interactive for the user to see which students got a skill right/wrong.
