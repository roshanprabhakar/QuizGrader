# QuizGrader
A quiz grader aimed to reduce the time it takes to grade free response test answers. Prototype aimed for AP Computer Science

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Make sure that the jdk is 64 bit and the project language level is at 8. 

### Installing

Runnable on any IDE (I prefer IntelliJ for easy setup and cloning).

```
 $ git clone https://github.com/wang0324/QuizGrader.git
```

### Running QuizGrader
1. Run Main
2. Make sure you have the videos in the folder Assets and select one of the videos in Assets. Currently only "TARGET_MOUSE_VIDEO.mp4" works fully.
3. Once it starts playing the video, press 'f' and type in the name of the animal tracking class. The default class is "AnimalTracker".
The other classes are there to assist with the AnimalTracker, and you can use them individually if you'd like.
4. This shows you the perspective after filtering the video. Press 's' to toggle between the original perspective and filtered perspective
5. If you would like to change the type of filter, press 'f' and type in the name of the class that performs the filter you would like.
